**FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:**

**1. Create traveling experiences for tourists rather than just attractions**

Traveling is an experience rather than just visiting attractions! In order to promote the tourism of India, we need to invest time and efforts in building traveling experiences for people brim with tour guides, activities for the children, culinary tours, interactivity for the tourist with the culture of the place, etc.

**2. More of Hygiene and amenities for kids and disabled**

Needless to say that we absolutely lack in these! Basic amenities such as restrooms near attractions, changing rooms at the beaches and garbage bins are what we lack presently. Further, even if some of our attractions might have those, they are left in horrible conditions enough to leave visitors puking

## 4. Marketing Strategies for image formation

## When it comes to tourism, social media is the best recourse these days! Due to its phenomenal reception and quality, social media and marketing today are the giants in defining a tourist quotient of a city, state or a country

## 5.Revisit the Unseen and unexplored

## We still need to explore the unseen and the unexplored in India. With so many virgin beaches and mountains gracing our land, there is still a lot to unravel before us and the world.
